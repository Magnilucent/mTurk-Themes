mTurk-Themes
============

NOTE: This repo is used to track development of mTurk Themes. All public releases will be released on GreasyFork.

This tool is meant to help theme Amazon Mechanical Turk. The JavaScript file is meant for use with GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey and uses functions from their API. Because of this the JavaScript file will not run outside of GreasyMonkey or TamperMonkey.

The JavaScript file is just UI that allows you to customize the CSS. The CSS uses a lot of tricks to get things the way I want on mTurk.com since I don't want to use JavaScript tp manipulate the DOM.
